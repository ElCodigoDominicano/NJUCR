# NJUCR
A small project I had in mind its merely for educational purposes (self), nothing more. free to use.

Caveat: The data; albeit open to the public, obtainable here -> [https://nj.gov/njsp/ucr/current-crime-data.shtml]
for Monmouth county sheet "inside the .xlsx files" contain duplicated rows. This program "assumes" data is formatted the same all around
might implement a fix for that over the course of time.

# Pretty simple to use
